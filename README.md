# CESI_WQ
Repository for NHS work on CESI for Water Quantity Indicators 2021 => ?

Initially I'm adding the files that Zhou Yang has refined; I have a separate repo for my tinkering.

Initial state is Zhou's versions as of 26/4/2021, uploaded here 4/5/2021. Next steps are integrating processing for flood and drought indicators.
